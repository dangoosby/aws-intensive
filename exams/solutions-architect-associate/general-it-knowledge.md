## General IT Knowledge

Descriptions, vocabulary, concepts, etc.

#### Multi-tier Architectures:
Client-Server architecture in which functions are separated (tiered) physically within the infrastructure and layered logically within the software solution.
- Web Servers
  - The system that processes requests via HTTP serving static content or cached content
- Caching
  - Temporary storage of web documents and media that makeup dynamic content in order to reduce bandwidth, server load and lag.
- Application Servers
  - Software framework that facilitates applications and their running server environments.
- Load Balancers
  - Improves distribution of workloads across multiple compute resources by optimizing throughput, minimizing response time and avoiding overloading any single resource.
- Storage
  - Storage/data tier includes persistence mechanisms and data access layer which should provide an API to the application tier that exposes methods of managing the stored data.

#### Databases:
- Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
  - Relational Database Management System is based on the Relational Model, an approach to managing data using structure and language consistent with first order predicate logic, most popular being SQL.
- NoSQL
  - Database providing a mechanism for storage and retreival of data that's modeled in means other than tabular relations used in RDBMS.

#### Messaging:
- Message queuing
  - Software-engineering components used for inter-process communication, or for inter-thread communication within the same process.
- Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
  - An enterprise service bus is implementing a communication system between mutually interacting software applications in a service-oriented-architecture.

#### Systems
- Loose coupling
  - A loosely coupled system is one where each of its components has, or makes use of, little or no knowledge of the other definitions of other separate components.
- Stateless
  - A stateless protocol is a communications protocol that treats each request as an independent transaction that is unrelated to any previous request so that the communication consists of independent pairs of request and response

#### Consistency Models
Consistency models are used in distributed systems and the system supports a given model if operations on memory follows specific rules. The data consistency model specifies a contract between programmer and system, wherein the system guarantees that is the programmer follows the rules, memory will be consistent and the results of memory operation will be predictable. Different consistency models enforce different conditions; a model with fewer constraints is considered a weaker consistency model.

#### Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
A Content Delivery Network is a globally distributed network of proxy servers deployed in multiple datacenters with the goal of serving content to end-users with high availability and high performance.

#### Core network technologies
- Local Area Network (LAN)
  - A computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area and has its network equipment locally managed.
- Wide Area Network (WAN)
  - Contrastly to a LAN, a Wide Area Network covers a larger geographic distance and generally involves leased telecommunication circuits or internet links.

#### Access
- Route Tables
  - A routing table is a data table stored in a router or networked  computer that lists the routes to particular network destinations and sometimes metrics associated with those routes.
- Access Control Lists
  - An access control list is a list of permissions attached to an object within a computer file system
- Firewall
  - A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
  - A method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in internet protocol (IP) datagram packet headers while they're in transit across a traffic routing device.
- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
  - An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems; foundation of the data communication for the web.
- Domain Name System (DNS)
  - A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services or any resource connected to the internet or a private network.
- Internet Protocol (IP)
  - The principal communications protocol in the internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries essentially establishing the internet.
- Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model
  - A conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecomm or computer system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.
