## Domain 1.0: Designing highly available, cost-efficient, fault-tolerant, scalable systems

Identify and recognize cloud architecture considerations, such as fundamental components and effective designs

---

#### How to design cloud services
#### Planning and design
#### Monitoring and logging
#### Familiarity with:
  - Best practices for AWS architecture
  - Developing to client specifications, including pricing/cost (e.g., on Demand vs. Reserved vs. Spot; RTO and RPO DR Design)
  - Architectural trade-off decisions (e.g., high availability vs. cost, Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) vs. installing your own database on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2))
  - Hybrid IT architectures (e.g., Direct Connect, Storage Gateway, VPC, Directory Services)
  - Elasticity and scalability (e.g., Auto Scaling, SQS, ELB, CloudFront)
